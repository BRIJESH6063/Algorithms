# Algorithms

Welcome to the Algorithm Repository! This repository contains C++ implementations of algorithmic problems solved using dynamic programming, greedy approach, and sorting algorithms. Whether you're preparing for coding interviews or simply sharpening your algorithmic skills, you'll find valuable resources and code examples here.

## Overview
Algorithms are the heart of computer science, providing efficient solutions to complex problems. In this repository, we explore various algorithmic techniques and approaches to tackle a wide range of problems, including dynamic programming, greedy approach, and sorting algorithms.


## Contents

1. Dynamic Programming: Dive into dynamic programming techniques to solve optimization problems efficiently. Explore problems such as the knapsack problem, longest common subsequence, coin change problem, and more.

2. Greedy Approach: Understand the greedy approach to problem-solving by making locally optimal choices at each step. Solve problems such as interval scheduling, minimum spanning tree (Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms), and Huffman coding.
3. Sorting Algorithms: Implement classic sorting algorithms such as bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort, and heap sort. Explore their time complexity, space complexity, and practical applications.






## Getting Started
To get started with using this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/BRIJESH6063/Algorithms.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Algorithms
    ```

3. Compile the C++ files using your preferred compiler:
    ```bash
    g++ -o dynamic_programming dynamic_programming.cpp
    g++ -o greedy_approach greedy_approach.cpp
    g++ -o sorting_algorithms sorting_algorithms.cpp

    ```
4. Execute the compiled programs and analyze the solutions to the algorithmic problems.
